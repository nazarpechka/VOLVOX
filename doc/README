the OpenSSL Toolkit (http://www.openssl.org/).  This product includes
cryptographic software written by Eric Young (eay@cryptsoft.com).


Intro
-----
Volvox is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.


Setup
-----
Compile or download Volvox wallet.

Unpack the files into a directory and run:
 bin/32/volvoxd (headless, 32-bit)
 bin/64/volvoxd (headless, 64-bit)

The software automatically finds other nodes to connect to.  You can
enable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) with your router/firewall
or forward port 9901 (TCP) to your computer so you can receive
incoming connections.  Volvox works without incoming connections,
but allowing incoming connections helps the Volvox network.


Upgrade
-------
All you existing coins/transactions should be intact with the upgrade.
To perform upgrade first backup wallet: 

VOLVOXd backupwallet <destination_backup_file>
Then shutdown volvoxd by
VOLVOXd stop

Start up the new VOLVOXd.
